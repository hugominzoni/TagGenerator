# TagGenerator

This is a JavaScript exercise where I identified a problem within the company that I work for and I created this simple but yet functional tag selector, where you can click in a tag, add it to an Array and copy with a click of a button.

The project was developed by the scratch and all the ideas and solutions were developed by me.

I understand that this solution is incredibly rustic and might have tons of improvement, but the whole goal was to create something by myself.

Cheers!
